          <p>Hello! My name is Adam. I'm a vet, so I've moved around a lot. One of the big things that stuck with me is my love of the internet. From websites to web based games &#40; Everquest &#41;, I've always been facinated on how everything works. Luckily, in 2020 I ended up realizing that I enjoy building things on the internet itself.
          <br/><br />
          Now if you move forward to today, I have been able to work with many small businesses on a variety of different projects. My main focus today is further developing my skills and helping businesses be seen in a way that allows their customers to really know what they're about.
